# Weather Application with React
During the last few months, I was mainly using Vue because of work, however I wanted to get back into using react so I recreated simple weather application.

## Overview
Insert gif of application

## Running the application
1. Clone the repository into your directory.
2. `cd` into application. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Make sure you have a `.env` file to input your API key or if you are not planning to push it then in the `WeatherApp.jsx` file on line 19 `let apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY;`
4. replace the `process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY` part with your own API key.
5. Then run `npm start` to launch the application
